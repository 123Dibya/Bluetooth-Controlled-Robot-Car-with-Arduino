# Bluetooth-Controlled-Robot-Car-with-Arduino
This repository contains Arduino code to control a two-wheel robot car using a Bluetooth module and an H-Bridge motor driver. The robot responds to Bluetooth commands sent via a smartphone or other devices to perform actions like moving forward, backward, turning left/right, and stopping.
